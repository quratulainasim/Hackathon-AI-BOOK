  "description": "This chapter provides a high-level overview of the integrated Capstone System, bringing together the concepts of Physical AI, ROS 2 fundamentals, Digital Twin Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac Platform, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoids into a cohesive functional architecture. It describes how these individual components interoperate to form a complete humanoid robotics solution capable of understanding natural language, perceiving its environment, planning actions, and executing them in a physical or simulated space.",
