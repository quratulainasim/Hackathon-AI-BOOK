# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book using Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code. Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy & Clarity
The book must adhere to clear technical writing standards for a computer science audience. Content must be factually accurate and presented lucidly.

### Research & Citation Integrity
All content must be supported by a minimum of 15 APA-style citations, with at least 50% from peer-reviewed research. Zero plagiarism is strictly enforced.

### Content Scope & Length
The book must cover the specified modules: ROS 2 Fundamentals, Digital Twin Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action. The final length must be between 5,000–7,000 words.

### Docusaurus & Output Format
The book will be formatted as a Docusaurus v3 docs site, outputting ready-to-publish Markdown files in `/docs` with `sidebars.js` navigation.


## Project Goal

To write a technical book on Physical AI (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA robotics) and publish it as a Docusaurus site.

## Workflow & Review

All content will undergo plagiarism checks before final publication. Technical reviews will ensure accuracy and adherence to writing standards.

## Governance
This constitution defines the core principles and requirements for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book". All contributions and development must align with these principles. Deviations require documented justification and approval.
